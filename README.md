# Zora Wan's Data Structure Projects

### Week 1 project: Convert 10 links in a javascript file to txt files.
  * Introduced to async
  * Use for loop to run the 10 htmls and use writeFileSync to txt files.

 ### Week 2 project: Base on my student ID, I parse [m03.txt](https://github.com/zorawan/DataStructures/blob/master/week1/data/m03.txt) to get all the address in the file.
  * By studying the HTML files, I learn how the html structure looks like and be able to pull the data from it.
  * takeaway:
    * Use children to target html tags.
    * Use remove() to remove html tags.
    * Use if(line.length >0) to check if the line is empty.
    * Use slice() to remove last extra line in the file.
     
### Week 3 project: Convert my addressBook.txt to a jason file.
  * By parsing the txt file, I learned to use split(), create json format and learned to use function to arrange the code to run in a correct sequence. 
  * takeaway:
    * Use split()[] to find an item
    * wrap code in a function to arrage the sequence.
    * Find values by key in json by using ["key"] and [number]
