# Zora Wan's Data Structure Projects

## Week 1 project: Convert 10 links in a javascript file to txt files.
  
## Week 2 project: Parse (https://github.com/zorawan/DataStructures/blob/master/week1/data/m03.txt) to get all the address.
 By studying the HTML files, I learn how the html structure looks like and be able to pull the data from it.
