### IOT - Using PHOTON and DHT22 temperature-humidity sensor + extras
#### Goal
By putting the temperature sensor next to my plants, I can monitor the temperature and humidity and adjust the best condition for them when I get an alert.
#### How
With a web app, I can see my three plants as a list with the description and tips as well as the current temperture it read from the sensor.
#### Prototype
[See how is it looks like](https://www.figma.com/proto/QF93lGmrqg0OezwcuYweYe/dataStructure?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=79%3A1141&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.11&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=79%3A1141)
* Drag left and right to see the two different status (temperature, humidity)
